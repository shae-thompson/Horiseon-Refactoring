# Horiseon-Refactoring
This homework task required that an existing ocde be edited to make the deployed application more user friendly. Through altering the HTML structure and adding semantic HTML elements, it was easier to continue with the additional. It created sections allowed for the files to be dispalyed in an order that was more functional.

Then adding alt attributes and links made the application more user friendly, by adding a backup should the images within the application fail to load and adding links to the header for users to be able to access specific information more easily.

Finally, adding a new title and ensuring the heding flowe sequentially were the finishing touches for the website. The title makes it so the user knows what the tab is for when the tab isn't open and the updating headings create flow within the text and add importance to some texts more than others.
